# WebOS_Magic_Remote_Motion_Control_to_PC
A quick and easy method to transfer the magic remote coordinates to a PC and control the mouse movement with it.

I. The web app:
Install the web application using developer mode, detailed information about the process can be accessed on LG's official website: https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app

II. The python server:
In order to recieve the input data from the LG tv app a python server has to be run on the machine. Make sure to install the required packages (http.server, pymouse, etc.:)

You can change and tweak the code to suit your needs, but if someone is intrested in using this as a complete app just open an issue here on github and I do my best to add more features.

This is just a very simple barebone app that I uploaded, so if someone is in a hurry and needs something that does exactly what this code can, that person is able to use it instead of writing it from scratch (although it's not too difficult). Feel free to modify it to suit your needs and excuse me for the lack of documentation but like I said this is not a complete app just something that works at the time being.
